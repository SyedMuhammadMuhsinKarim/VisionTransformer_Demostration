# Vision Transformer (ViT) for Object Detection with YOLO Labels

This project implements an object detection system using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The dataset is structured using YOLO format annotations, and the model is trained using PyTorch.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the Vision Transformer (ViT) for object detection tasks using YOLO-formatted datasets. We use the transformer architecture for image feature extraction and add a custom detection head for bounding box regression and class prediction.

## Installation

To set up this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have `Python 3.8+` installed, along with `pip`.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vit-object-detection.git
cd vit-object-detection
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation

1. Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OS3qGTbYhzoH0PA6PrnkTt1vbq5B1x09/view?usp=sharing).
2. Extract the dataset into the `data/images/` directory.
3. Ensure the labels are in the `data/labels/` directory, following the YOLO format.

## Training the Model

To train the model, navigate to the `src/` directory and run:

```bash
python train.py
```

You can adjust hyperparameters in `train.py` as needed.

## Running Inference

To run inference on a new image, use the following command:

```bash
python inference.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
```

The detected objects will be displayed with bounding boxes and labels.

## Results

After training, the model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision). The results will be logged in the training process.
